# Housing_Price_Prediction_Random_Forest

## Project Description

This repository contains code to train a machine learning model to predict median housing prices based on features like housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, households, and median income. The model uses a Random Forest Regressor to estimate housing prices.

## Features Used
- housing_median_age
- total_rooms
- total_bedrooms
- households
- median_income

## Target Variable
- median_house_value

## About Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method for regression (and classification) that builds many decision trees and averages their outputs to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

## Results

The script prints:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE) - measures the average prediction error.
- RÂ² Score - indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.

## Future Improvements

- Add hyperparameter tuning.
- Perform advanced data preprocessing.
- Test other regression models.
